# Foot-Ulcer-Segmentation

This project focuses on the segmentation of **foot ulcers**, which falls into the category of *chronic wounds*.
Therefore a model was implemented that can **identify and segment wound areas** from images of foot ulcers. The model was developed for the *Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge 2021* on the Grand Challenge Platform [1].

## Background

Foot ulcers are wounds that appear on the feet, typically on the sides or bottom of the feet. They are a common problem for individuals with diabetes, poor circulation, neuropathy, and other foot conditions. These ulcers can be challenging to heal and can result in severe complications such as infection, tissue death, and even amputation if left untreated. Several risk factors increase the likelihood of developing foot ulcers, such as age, a history of foot injuries or surgery, poor circulation, and diabetes.

Foot ulcers fall into the category of **chronic wounds**. Chronic wounds often require hospitalization and additional treatment which are billions in cost for health services annually. In addition to that, there is a shortage of well-trained wound care clinicians which decreases access and quality of care to millions of patients. On top of that, manual measurement of clinicians is time-consuming and sometimes inaccurate. Deep neural networks, once well-trained, yield far more accurate and consistent results compared to clinicians. Therefore, a reasonable solution is the development of a fully automatic segmentation model of wound areas in natural images.
